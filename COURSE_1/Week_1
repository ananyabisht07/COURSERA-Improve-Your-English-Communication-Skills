Subject : Cancellation of order.

Dear ABC Furniture,

My name is Kevin Johnson. This letter is to inform you that I would like to cancel my order of the office chair that I ordered last week as it was already bought by some other staff member.
It would be kind enough if the full refund is send to my account. I am incredibly sorry for all the trouble and inconvenience caused.

Thanking you,

Sincerely,

Kevin Johnson
