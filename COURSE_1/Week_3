 # Assignment:3
Write a new email
If you do not need to revise your original email, write an email to introduce two people to each other. For example, you can introduce two 
colleagues to each other. Or maybe you want to introduce somebody for a job opening at your company.

Sample letter for introducing two people.
(There are two people Matt and Sarah, and I am introducing them both to eacother through this email.)

Subject: Matt, have you met Sarah?

Matt and Sarah, I am pleased to introduce you two.

Matt, Sarah is the person I told you about in our last meeting. She is a communication consultant in Los Angeles. She guides the organizations to create and deliver internal communication that helps organizations to achieve department goals. Her email id is sarahmoore@gmail.com.
Sarah, Matt Johnson is Founder of IdeaLaunch, a business writing firm in Los Angeles. His email id is mattjohnson011@gmail.com.
Thinking there is high potential of you two working together, it would be great if you both find time to meet and know each other. Now I'll let both of you to take from here.

Regards,
Ananya Bisht
